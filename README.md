# FarmFinder

## Inspiration
FarmFinder was inspired by a desire to bridge the gap between consumers and local farmers' markets. We are passionate about helping local communities find fresh, organic food, promoting local food systems, and supporting local small-scale farmers and producers.

## What it does
FarmFinder uses an interactive map to help users find farmers' markets in their vicinity. Users may enter a zip code to discover nearby locations and their details.

## How we built it
FarmFinder is a website built using JavaScript and Bulma, a CSS framework, Google Maps API, and databases from the USDA Local Food Directories.

## Challenges we ran into
Outdate APIs and poorly formatted data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working around with Google Maps API and poorly formatted databases to reverse geocode each entry and retrieve the addresses.
